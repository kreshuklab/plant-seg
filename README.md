![Illustration of Pipeline](../assets/images/main_figure_nologo.png)

[PlantSeg](plantseg) is a tool for cell instance aware segmentation in densely packed 3D volumetric images.
The pipeline uses a two stages segmentation strategy (Neural Network + Segmentation).
The pipeline is tuned for plant cell tissue acquired with confocal and light sheet microscopy.
Pre-trained models are provided.

## Installation

The easiest way to get PlantSeg is using the installer. [**Download it here**](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/72b4bd3ba5f14409bfee/)

The installer comes with python and conda.
Please go to the [documentation](https://kreshuklab.github.io/plant-seg/chapters/getting_started/installation/) for more detailed instructions.

For development, we recommend to clone the repo and install using:

```bash
conda env create -f environment-dev.yaml
```

The above command will create new conda environment `plant-seg-dev` together with all required dependencies.

## Repository Index

The PlantSeg repository is organised as follows:

* **plantseg**: Contains the source code of PlantSeg.
