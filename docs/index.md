# PanSeg introduction

!!! tip "PanSeg v2 is out!"
    We switched to Napari as our front-end!
    You now can interactively work on your images in PanSeg.
    The project was renamed to **PanSeg** instead of **PlantSeg**!

PanSeg is a tool for 3D and 2D segmentation.
The methods used are very generic and can be used for any instance segmentation workflow,
but they are tuned towards cell segmentation in plant tissue. The tool is fundamentally composed of two main steps.

* ***Cell boundary prediction***: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to perform voxel-wise boundary classification. This network is adept at filtering out diverse types and intensities of noise, homogenizing signal strength, and correcting imaging defects such as blurred or missing cell boundaries. This step ensures a high-quality boundary prediction which is crucial for accurate segmentation.

* ***Cell Segmentation as graph partitioning***: The boundary prediction from the first step serve as the basis for automated segmentation. PanSeg implements four distinct algorithms for this task, each with unique features tailored to different segmentation needs. This graph partitioning approach is particularly effective for segmenting densely packed cells.

## PanSeg & PlantSeg

This project stated 2020 as `PlantSeg`, but its capabilities are not
restricted to plant cells! To better reflect that, for the 2.0 release
we changed the name to `PanSeg`, referring to plant and animal cells.
