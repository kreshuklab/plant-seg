# PlantSeg introduction

!!! tip "PlantSeg v2 is out!"
    In this update, we switched to Napari as our front-end!
    You now can interactively work on your images in PlantSeg.

PlantSeg is a tool for 3D and 2D segmentation.
The methods used are very generic and can be used for any instance segmentation workflow,
but they are tuned towards cell segmentation in plant tissue. The tool is fundamentally composed of two main steps.

* ***Cell boundary prediction***: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to perform voxel-wise boundary classification. This network is adept at filtering out diverse types and intensities of noise, homogenizing signal strength, and correcting imaging defects such as blurred or missing cell boundaries. This step ensures a high-quality boundary prediction which is crucial for accurate segmentation.

* ***Cell Segmentation as graph partitioning***: The boundary prediction from the first step serve as the basis for automated segmentation. PlantSeg implements four distinct algorithms for this task, each with unique features tailored to different segmentation needs. This graph partitioning approach is particularly effective for segmenting densely packed cells.
