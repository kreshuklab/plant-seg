# Custom Datasets

To train own models from multiple images, you need to create a dataset first.
This dataset is just a file structure so PlantSeg knows how to load the training data.
It should look like this:

```
mydataset/
├── train/
│   ├── first.h5
│   └── second.h5
└── val/
    ├── val_one.h5
    └── val_two.h5 
```

The recommended way to train new models is through the [napari training GUI](../plantseg_interactive_napari/unet_training.md).
