# UNet Training

!!! Note "New Feature!"
    Train you model right from the GUI!

With PlantSeg you can train bespoke segmentation models!
This is especially useful to get great results on a big dataset for which
the build-in models work not perfectly.  
First proofread some images from the dataset. Then train a new model on this
high-quality data, and run it on the whole dataset.

You can also fine-tune an existing model.
