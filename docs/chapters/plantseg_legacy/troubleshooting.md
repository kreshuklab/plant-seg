## Font size problems in GUI

If you find the font size varies within either Napari or Legacy GUIs, or some buttons or texts are not visible, it might relate to your system's DPI settings or screen resolution. To fix this, you can try to reset the resolution of your system.

## Problems with `--headless` and `dask[distributed]`

If you encounter the following error:

```plaintext
ImportError: dask.distributed is not installed.
```

Please install `dask[distributed]` to enable headless mode in PlantSeg. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
mamba activate plant-seg
mamba install -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge dask distributed
```

----

## Could not load library `libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8`

If you encounter this error:

```plaintext
Could not load library libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8. Error: libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Resolve this by installing `cudnn` using the following command:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge cudnn
```

----

## Missing configuration key errors

If you encounter a `RuntimeError` about a missing key, such as:

```plaintext
RuntimeError: key : 'crop_volume' is missing, plant-seg requires 'crop_volume' to run
```

This usually means the session configuration file is corrupted or outdated. To fix this:

```bash
rm ~/.plantseg_models/configs/config_gui_last.yaml
```

Ensure your configuration file is properly formatted and includes all required keys. Example configurations can be found in the `examples` directory of this repository.

----

## Cannot import `lifted_problem_from_probabilities`

If you receive an error related to importing from `elf.segmentation.features`, reinstall [elf](https://github.com/constantinpape/elf):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge python-elf
```

----

## Other issues

PlantSeg is actively developed, and sometimes model or configuration files saved in `~/.plantseg_models` may become outdated. If you encounter errors related to configuration loading:

1. Close the PlantSeg application.
2. Delete the `~/.plantsep_models` directory.
3. Restart the application and try again.

These steps should help resolve any issues and enhance your experience with PlantSeg.
