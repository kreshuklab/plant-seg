    """Compute Adapted Rand error as defined by the SNEMI3D contest [1]
    Formula is given as 1 - the maximal F-score of the Rand index
    (excluding the zero component of the original labels). Adapted
    from the SNEMI3D MATLAB script, hence the strange style.
    Parameters
    ----------
    seg : np.ndarray
        the segmentation to score, where each value is the label at that point
    gt : np.ndarray, same shape as seg
        the groundtruth to score against, where each value is a label
    all_stats : boolean, optional
        whether to also return precision and recall as a 3-tuple with rand_error
    Returns
    -------
    are : float
        The adapted Rand error; equal to $1 - \frac{2pr}{p + r}$,
        where $p$ and $r$ are the precision and recall described below.
    prec : float, optional
        The adapted Rand precision. (Only returned when `all_stats` is ``True``.)
    rec : float, optional
        The adapted Rand recall.  (Only returned when `all_stats` is ``True``.)
